The dashboard is the main page of a user's account.

The dashboard also consists of the logo at the top right and 4 buttons with which you can interact:

1) Toggle Dark Mode;
2) Edit;
3) Logout;
4) Delete account

#### Toggle Dark Mode

On this page the user will be allowed to change their data (name, email and password).

In order to be able to make the password change you will first have to enter the password currently in use and then the new password that you will have to repeat a second time.

In the textfileds of the edit page the same rules apply as in the case of registration, such as character limit, email in the right format, etc..

### PAGENOTFOUND

This page will be possible to view, only in case the user tries to access in a non-existing path.

## ROUTES:

The site consists of 4 routes, 2 of which are protected (user needs to be logged in for access):

### Free routes:

1) ``` '/signin' ```,
2) ``` '/signup' ```.

### Protected routes:

1) ``` '/dashboard' ```,
2) ``` '/edit' ```.

In case the user tries to access non-existing routes he will be automatically inderiorated to the error page.

#### EXPRESS

#### JSONWEBTOKEN

The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted.

#### MONGOOSE

#### PASSPORT

Passport's sole purpose is to authenticate requests, which it does through an extensible set of plugins known as strategies. Passport does not mount routes or assume any particular database schema, which maximizes flexibility and allows application-level decisions to be made by the developer. The API is simple: you provide Passport a request to authenticate, and Passport provides hooks for controlling what occurs when authentication succeeds or fails.

#### PASSPORT-JWT

A Passport strategy for authenticating with a JSON Web Token.

This module lets you authenticate endpoints using a JSON web token. It is intended to be used to secure RESTful endpoints without sessions.
